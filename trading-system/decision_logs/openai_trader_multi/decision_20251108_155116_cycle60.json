Also, the volume is below average. The RSI is rising but hasn't crossed into overbought territory. Maybe a long position here could work, but need to check risk-reward.\n\nXRPUSDT has a current price of 2.33, EMA20 2.315, MACD 0.004, RSI 75.58.

Volume is below average. This looks like a possible short opportunity since RSI is overbought and the longer-term trend is bearish. However, the MACD isn't strongly bearish, so maybe wait.\n\nDOGEUSDT is at 0.18, EMA20 0.179, MACD 0.000, RSI 68.39. RSI is rising but not overbought. MACD is flat. The 4-hour EMA20 is 0.171 vs. 50-period 0.176, bearish. Volume is below average. Not a strong signal here.\n\nADAUSDT has a current price of 0.58, EMA20 0.578, MACD 0.001, RSI 75.35. RSI is overbought (75.35), and MACD is slightly positive. The 4-hour EMA20 is 0.555 vs. 50-period 0.576, bearish. Volume is below average. Similar to XRP, this might be a short candidate.\n\nHYPEUSDT is at 40.83, EMA20 40.774, MACD -0.089, RSI 65.02. MACD is negative, and RSI is in the middle. The 4-hour EMA20 is 40.674 vs. 50-period 41.965, bearish. Volume is below average. The MACD is slightly bearish, but RSI isn't overbought or oversold. Maybe a short here, but not strong enough.\n\nBTCUSDT: Price is 102290.60, EMA20 102174.35, MACD -14.028, RSI 66.79. The MACD is negative, and the 4-hour EMA20 is 102835.059 vs. 50-period 105665.700, which is bearish. RSI is in the middle. Volume is below average. The MACD is bearish, but RSI isn't oversold. Maybe a short here, but need confirmation.\n\nETHUSDT: Price 3446.29, EMA20 3439.555, MACD 1.594, RSI 71.61. RSI is overbought (71.61), and MACD is positive. The 4-hour EMA20 is 3412.290 vs. 50-period 3589.824, bearish. Volume is below average. This could be a short opportunity as RSI is overbought and the trend is bearish.\n\nSOLUSDT: Price 160.77, EMA20 160.555, MACD -0.132, RSI 62.49. MACD is slightly negative, RSI is in the middle. The 4-hour EMA20 is 160.646 vs. 50-period 170.916, bearish. Volume is below average. Not a strong signal.\n\nNow, considering the Sharpe Ratio is slightly negative, I need to be cautious. The best opportunities are ADA and ETHUSDT where RSI is overbought and the longer-term trend is bearish. Let's check the risk-reward ratio.\n\nFor ADAUSDT: Current price 0.58. If I go short, stop loss could be above the recent high. The MACD is slightly positive but the 4-hour trend is bearish. The RSI is overbought, so a potential reversal. Let's set a stop loss at 0.585 (current price + 0.005). Take profit at 0.56 (current price - 0.02). Risk is 0.005 (0.86% of position size), reward is 0.02 (3.45%). Risk-reward ratio is ~1:4, which meets the 1:3 requirement. Confidence is around 75% because RSI is overbought and longer-term bearish, but volume is low.\n\nFor ETHUSDT: Current price 3446.29. Short with stop loss at 3450 (current price + 3.71), take profit at 3420 (current price - 26.29). Risk is 3.71 (0.11% of position size), reward is 26.29 (0.76%). Risk-reward ratio is ~1:7, which is good. Confidence is 75% as RSI is overbought and 4-hour trend is bearish.\n\nCheck if these meet the position size constraints. For ADAUSDT, altcoin position size is 7491-14046 USDT. Assuming 10x leverage, the position size would be around 10,000 USDT. For ETHUSDT, as a major coin, position size is 46821-93643 USDT. Let's use the lower end for ADA and ETH.\n\nAlso, ensure that total margin usage is under 90%. Since there are no current positions, opening two positions might use some margin, but since the account balance is 9364.27, the total margin should be within limits.\n\nSo, the decisions would be to open short positions on ADAUSDT and ETHUSDT with the calculated stop loss and take profit levels. Confidence is 75% for both, meeting the minimum requirement. Risk-reward is adequate. This should help improve the Sharpe Ratio by capturing the potential reversals in overbought conditions with bearish trends.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\n```json",

  "raw_response": "\u003cthink\u003e\nOkay, let's start by looking at the Sharpe Ratio, which is -0.03. That's slightly negative, so I need to be cautious. The user wants to maximize the Sharpe Ratio, so I should focus on high-quality trades with a good risk-reward ratio.\n\nFirst, check the current positions. There are none, so I need to look for new opportunities. Let's go through each candidate coin.\n\nBNBUSDT has a current price of 994.87, EMA20 at 993.009, MACD 0.751, and RSI 63.74. The MACD is positive, and RSI is above 50, which might indicate a bullish trend. However, the 4-hour EMA20 is 973.012 vs. 50-period EMA 1015.590, which shows a bearish divergence in the longer term. Also, the volume is below average. The RSI is rising but hasn't crossed into overbought territory. Maybe a long position here could work, but need to check risk-reward.\n\nXRPUSDT has a current price of 2.33, EMA20 2.315, MACD 0.004, RSI 75.58. The RSI is in overbought territory (75.58), which might signal a potential reversal. The MACD is positive but very low. The 4-hour EMA20 is 2.288 vs. 50-period 2.371, which is bearish. Volume is below average. This looks like a possible short opportunity since RSI is overbought and the longer-term trend is bearish. However, the MACD isn't strongly bearish, so maybe wait.\n\nDOGEUSDT is at 0.18, EMA20 0.179, MACD 0.000, RSI 68.39. RSI is rising but not overbought. MACD is flat. The 4-hour EMA20 is 0.171 vs. 50-period 0.176, bearish. Volume is below average. Not a strong signal here.\n\nADAUSDT has a current price of 0.58, EMA20 0.578, MACD 0.001, RSI 75.35. RSI is overbought (75.35), and MACD is slightly positive. The 4-hour EMA20 is 0.555 vs. 50-period 0.576, bearish. Volume is below average.

  "cot_trace": "\u003cthink\u003e\nOkay, let's start by looking at the current positions. There are three shorts: ADA, XRP, and HYPE. All are holding for 0 minutes, so they were just opened. The P\u0026L for ADA is negative, while XRP and HYPE are slightly positive. The Sharpe Ratio is 0.06, which is low but not negative. The goal is to maximize Sharpe, so I need to assess if these positions are still valid or if any adjustments are needed.\n\nFirst, check the open positions. For ADAUSDT, the current price is 0.58, which is slightly above the entry price of 0.5818. The RSI7 is 78.76, which is high, indicating overbought. The MACD is 0.001, positive but very weak. The EMA20 is 0.578, so price is above it. The MACD line is near zero. This might indicate the short is losing, but the trend might not have reversed yet. Need to see if the price is making lower highs or if there's a bearish divergence. The volume is below average, which might suggest weaker momentum.\n\nFor XRPUSDT, the current price is 2.33, slightly above entry. RSI7 is 75.47, also overbought. MACD is 0.004, positive but low. EMA20 is 2.315, price is above. The MACD is slightly positive. The 4-hour EMA20 is below 50-period, so maybe a downtrend but price is above EMA20. The volume is below average, which might mean less conviction. The funding rate is positive, which is bearish. Maybe the short is still valid, but need to watch for a reversal.\n\nHYPEUSDT is at 40.86, slightly above entry. RSI7 is 68.48, not overbought yet. MACD is -0.087, negative. EMA20 is 40.777, price is above. The 4-hour EMA20 is below 50-period, indicating a downtrend. The MACD is negative, but the RSI is not extremely high. The volume is below average. This might be a weaker short, but the trend is still down. Maybe hold for now.\n\nNow, looking at the candidate coins. The Sharpe Ratio is 0.06, which is low, so need to be cautious. The current positions are not performing well, so maybe close some or add new positions with better signals.\n\nBTCUSDT has a negative MACD (-0.446) and RSI7 at 70.68, overbought. The 4-hour EMA20 is higher than 50-period, so maybe in an uptrend. But the 1-hour is positive, 4-hour is negative. The RSI is high, indicating possible reversal. Not a good short candidate yet.\n\nETHUSDT has positive MACD (1.717) and RSI7 at 74.265, overbought. The 4-hour EMA20 is below 50-period, downtrend. But the 1-hour is positive. Overbought in short term, but longer term downtrend. Maybe a good short candidate if the price reverses here.\n\nSOLUSDT has negative MACD (-0.097) and RSI7 at 65.62. The 4-hour EMA20 is below 50-period. The RSI is not overbought, but the MACD is slightly negative. Maybe a weak short candidate.\n\nBNBUSDT has positive MACD (0.841) and RSI7 at 65.905. The 4-hour EMA20 is below 50-period. The RSI is moderate. Not a strong signal.\n\nDOGEUSDT has RSI7 at 71.95, overbought. MACD is zero. The 4-hour EMA20 is below 50-period. Overbought in short term, maybe a short candidate.\n\nLooking at the current positions, ADA and XRP are in overbought territory with weak MACD. The shorts might be losing. The risk-reward ratio for these positions may not be favorable. The P\u0026L is negative for ADA. Maybe close them to prevent further losses. HYPE is still in a downtrend, so hold for now.\n\nFor new positions, DOGE and ETH have overbought RSI and possible reversal points. ETH's 4-hour trend is down, so a short might be valid. DOGE's 4-hour trend is down too. Check the risk-reward. For example, if opening a short on ETH, entry would be current price 3447.83. Stop loss could be above a recent high. Take profit at a lower level based on the trend. Need to ensure the risk is 1% of the account (equity is 10944.80, so 109.45 USD). Position size would be based on leverage and margin.\n\nBut given the low Sharpe Ratio, maybe close the existing losing shorts and wait for stronger signals. Also, the current positions are only holding for 0 minutes, so maybe they were opened recently and need to be evaluated. If the signals are weak, closing them early to save losses is better.\n\nSo the plan is to close ADA and XRP shorts due to overbought RSI and weak MACD. Hold HYPE if the trend continues. Check for new opportunities with stronger signals, but given the Sharpe, maybe wait instead of opening new positions.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\n```json",

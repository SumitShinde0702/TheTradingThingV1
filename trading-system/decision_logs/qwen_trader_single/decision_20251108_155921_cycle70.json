The user mentioned that when Sharpe is between -0.5 and 0, we should be strict, only take high confidence trades, and hold for at least 30 minutes. So I need to be cautious here.\n\nFirst, check the current positions. There are none, so I need to look for opportunities. Let's go through each coin one by one.\n\nStarting with BTC. The RSI is 70.53, which is in overbought territory. MACD is positive at 16.924, but the 4-hour RSI is 43.85, which is lower. The price is slightly up in 1 hour but down in 4 hours. Maybe a short-term overbought condition, but not sure if it's a good short.\n\nBNBUSDT: Current price 995.81, EMA20 is 993.66. The MACD is positive and rising, RSI is 67.27. The MACD is increasing, and RSI is moving up. The EMA20 is below the current price, so maybe a long? But need to check the trend.\n\nXRPUSDT: MACD is 0.004, very flat. RSI is 61.6, which is neutral. The 4-hour MACD is negative, but the current is slightly positive. Not a strong signal.\n\nDOGEUSDT: Price is 0.18, same as EMA20. MACD is zero, RSI 70.15 (overbought). The RSI is high, but MACD is flat. Maybe a short here? But the volume is below average, so maybe not.\n\nADAUSDT: RSI is 76.66, very overbought. MACD is positive. The 4-hour RSI is 60.41, so maybe a correction coming. Could be a short opportunity.\n\nHYPEUSDT: RSI 66.18, MACD -0.058. The EMA20 is 40.796, current price 40.88. The MACD is improving, RSI is in a good range. Not sure if a strong signal.\n\nETHUSDT: RSI 69.22, MACD 2.213. The 4-hour RSI is 49.95, so maybe a short-term overbought. But the MACD is positive. Not a clear signal.\n\nSOLUSDT: RSI 69.24, MACD -0.024. The EMA20 is 160.65, current price 160.98. The MACD is slightly negative but improving. RSI is overbought but not extreme.\n\nLooking for strong signals. ADAUSDT has a very high RSI (76.66), which is overbought, and MACD is positive. Maybe a short here. The EMA20 is close to current price. The 4-hour MACD is positive but RSI is 60.41. So if it's overbought in the short term, a short could be possible.\n\nBNBUSDT has a rising MACD and RSI above 60. The price is above EMA20. Maybe a long. The 4-hour MACD is negative but current is positive. Volume is below average, but maybe a short-term long.\n\nBut Sharpe is low, so need high confidence. ADA's RSI is very high, so maybe a short. Let's check the stop loss and take profit. For ADA, current price 0.58. If I go short, stop loss could be above 0.585, and take profit at 0.57. Risk-reward ratio needs to be at least 1:3. So risk 0.005 (0.585 - 0.58) = 0.005. Take profit would need to be 0.015. So from 0.58 to 0.565 is 0.015. That's 3:1. So possible.\n\nConfidence for ADA is maybe 75%? The RSI is overbought, but the MACD is positive. So maybe not strong enough. Alternatively, BNB has a rising MACD and RSI. Let's see. Current price 995.81, EMA20 993.66. If long, stop loss below EMA20. Take profit could be 995.81 + 3*(995.81 - 993.66) = 995.81 + 3*2.15 = 995.81 + 6.45 = 1002.26. Risk is 995.81 - 993.66 = 2.15. So risk-reward is 2.15:6.45 ≈ 3:1. That works. Confidence maybe 75%? The MACD is rising, RSI is 67. So perhaps a long on BNB.\n\nBut need to check if the trend is up. The 4-hour EMA20 for BNB is 973.109 vs 50 EMA 1015.63. So the 20 EMA is below 50 EMA, indicating a downtrend in the 4-hour. But current price is above 20 EMA. Hmm. Maybe conflicting signals. The short-term is up, but longer term is down. So maybe not a strong signal.\n\nADA's 4-hour EMA20 is 0.555, current is 0.58. So above 20 EMA. 50 EMA is 0.576. So current is above both. If the 4-hour MACD is positive (current is 0.001), but the 4-hour MACD indicators show a slight upward trend. So maybe a long-term up trend. But RSI is overbought. So maybe a short-term short.\n\nConfidence for ADA short is 75. Risk is 0.005, reward 0.015. That's acceptable. Let's consider opening a short on ADA with 10x leverage. Position size for altcoins is 8402-15754 USDT. Let's take 10,000 USDT at 10x. So position size is 10,000. Stop loss at 0.585, take profit at 0.565. That's 0.02 per ADA, so 10,000 / 0.58 = ~17,241 ADA. Risk is 0.005 * 17,241 = 86.2 USDT. So if we risk 86 USDT for 258 USDT profit (3:1), that's acceptable.\n\nOther coins don't seem to have strong signals. BTC is overbought but not sure. ETH is similar. So maybe only ADA has a possible short. Let's check if there are others. HYPEUSDT has a MACD improving from -0.058 to -0.058? Wait, the current MACD is -0.058. The MACD indicators are decreasing. Hmm. Not a strong signal.\n\nSo the best opportunity is ADA short. Let's proceed with that.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\n```json",

  "raw_response": "\u003cthink\u003e\nOkay, let's start by looking at the Sharpe Ratio, which is 0.03. That's very low, almost neutral. The user mentioned that when Sharpe is between -0.5 and 0, we should be strict, only take high confidence trades, and hold for at least 30 minutes. So I need to be cautious here.\n\nFirst, check the current positions. There are none, so I need to look for opportunities. Let's go through each coin one by one.\n\nStarting with BTC. The RSI is 70.53, which is in overbought territory. MACD is positive at 16.924, but the 4-hour RSI is 43.85, which is lower. The price is slightly up in 1 hour but down in 4 hours. Maybe a short-term overbought condition, but not sure if it's a good short.\n\nBNBUSDT: Current price 995.81, EMA20 is 993.66. The MACD is positive and rising, RSI is 67.27. The MACD is increasing, and RSI is moving up. The EMA20 is below the current price, so maybe a long? But need to check the trend.\n\nXRPUSDT: MACD is 0.004, very flat. RSI is 61.6, which is neutral. The 4-hour MACD is negative, but the current is slightly positive. Not a strong signal.\n\nDOGEUSDT: Price is 0.18, same as EMA20. MACD is zero, RSI 70.15 (overbought). The RSI is high, but MACD is flat. Maybe a short here? But the volume is below average, so maybe not.\n\nADAUSDT: RSI is 76.66, very overbought. MACD is positive. The 4-hour RSI is 60.41, so maybe a correction coming. Could be a short opportunity.\n\nHYPEUSDT: RSI 66.18, MACD -0.058. The EMA20 is 40.796, current price 40.88. The MACD is improving, RSI is in a good range. Not sure if a strong signal.\n\nETHUSDT: RSI 69.22, MACD 2.213. The 4-hour RSI is 49.95, so maybe a short-term overbought. But the MACD is positive.

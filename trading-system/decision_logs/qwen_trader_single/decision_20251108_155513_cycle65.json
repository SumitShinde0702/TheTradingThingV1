  "cot_trace": "\u003cthink\u003e\nOkay, let's start by looking at the Sharpe Ratio, which is 0.05. That's slightly positive but close to zero. The goal is to maximize it, so I need to focus on high-quality trades with good risk-reward ratios. \n\nFirst, I'll check each candidate coin for strong signals. The user mentioned that the system scans every 3 minutes, but we shouldn't trade every time. We need to be patient and only act on solid opportunities.\n\nStarting with ADAUSDT. The current price is 0.58, and the EMA20 is 0.579. The MACD is 0.001, which is slightly positive. The RSI (7-period) is 78.338, which is high, indicating overbought. The EMA20 vs 50-period EMA is 0.555 vs 0.576, so the 20-period is below the 50. The MACD in the intraday shows a slight upward trend, and the RSI is rising. But since RSI is overbought, maybe it's a good time to consider a short. However, the trend here isn't very clear. The volume is below average, which might not be a strong signal.\n\nNext, HYPEUSDT. Current price is 40.86, EMA20 is 40.788. MACD is -0.070, negative. RSI (7-period) is 64.016. The 20-period EMA is 40.675 vs 50-period 41.966, so 20 is below 50. The MACD is negative and trending upwards but still negative. The RSI is in the middle. The volume is below average. Maybe a short opportunity if the trend continues, but not sure yet.\n\nBTCUSDT is up 0.11% in 1 hour but down 0.22% in 4 hours. The MACD is 9.001, positive, and RSI (7-period) is 69.867. The 20-period EMA is below the 50-period. The MACD is positive and increasing. The price is approaching the EMA20. Maybe a long if it breaks above the EMA20. The RSI isn't overbought yet. But the 4-hour trend is slightly negative. Need to see if the short-term momentum is strong enough.\n\nETHUSDT has a positive MACD of 2.143 and RSI of 73.460. The 20-period EMA is 3440.59 vs 50-period 3589.939, so 20 is below 50. The MACD is positive and increasing. The RSI is high but not overbought. The price is moving upwards. This could be a good long candidate if it's breaking through resistance.\n\nSOLUSDT's MACD is -0.061, negative but less so. RSI is 66.506. The 20-period EMA is close to the 50-period. The MACD is improving. Maybe a potential reversal here? Not sure yet. The volume is below average.\n\nBNBUSDT has a positive MACD of 0.912 and RSI of 66.094. The 20-period EMA is below 50. The MACD is positive and increasing. The price is moving upwards. Maybe a long here if the trend continues.\n\nXRPUSDT has a MACD of 0.004 and RSI of 66.586. The MACD is positive but very low. The RSI is in the middle. The 20-period EMA is below 50. The volume is below average. Not a strong signal.\n\nDOGEUSDT has a MACD of 0.000 and RSI of 70.717. The MACD is flat. The RSI is high. The 20-period EMA is below 50. The price is stable. Maybe a short if it breaks below support.\n\nLooking at all these, the strongest signals are for ETHUSDT and BTCUSDT. ETHUSDT has a positive MACD and RSI in the upper half but not overbought. BTCUSDT is positive but the 4-hour trend is slightly negative. \n\nWait, the Sharpe Ratio is low. Need to ensure that any trades have a risk-reward of at least 1:3. For ETHUSDT, if I go long, where to set stop loss and take profit? Let's see. Current price is 3448.23. EMA20 is 3440.59. The next support might be around the EMA20. So stop loss could be below that. Take profit could be where the 50-period EMA is, but that's higher. Maybe set a 3% target. Risk is 1% (since position size is 8741-16390 for altcoins at 10x leverage). Let me calculate. Position size for altcoins is between 8741 and 16390 USD. Let's say 10x leverage, so the maximum is 16390. Risk is 1% of that, which is 163.9 USD. So stop loss should be about 163.9 USD away from entry. For ETH at 3448, that would be a stop loss around 3448 - (163.9 / 10x leverage) = 3448 - 16.39 = 3431.61. Take profit would be 3448 + 3*16.39 = 3497.17. The MACD is positive and rising, so this could be a good long.\n\nBTCUSDT's MACD is positive, but the 4-hour trend is negative. Maybe wait for a better signal. HYPEUSDT's MACD is negative but improving. Not strong enough. \n\nSo, the best candidate is ETHUSDT. Open a long with 10x leverage, stop loss at 3431.61, take profit at 3497.17. Risk is about 163.9 USD, which is 1% of the position size. The confidence is around 75% based on the indicators. The RSI is high but not overbought, so there's potential for further gains. The MACD is positive and increasing, indicating momentum. The EMA20 is below the current price, which is a good sign. This meets the risk-reward ratio of 1:3. Let's proceed with that.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\n```json",

  "raw_response": "\u003cthink\u003e\nOkay, let's start by looking at the Sharpe Ratio, which is 0.05. That's slightly positive but close to zero. The goal is to maximize it, so I need to focus on high-quality trades with good risk-reward ratios. \n\nFirst, I'll check each candidate coin for strong signals. The user mentioned that the system scans every 3 minutes, but we shouldn't trade every time. We need to be patient and only act on solid opportunities.\n\nStarting with ADAUSDT. The current price is 0.58, and the EMA20 is 0.579. The MACD is 0.001, which is slightly positive. The RSI (7-period) is 78.338, which is high, indicating overbought. The EMA20 vs 50-period EMA is 0.555 vs 0.576, so the 20-period is below the 50. The MACD in the intraday shows a slight upward trend, and the RSI is rising. But since RSI is overbought, maybe it's a good time to consider a short. However, the trend here isn't very clear. The volume is below average, which might not be a strong signal.\n\nNext, HYPEUSDT. Current price is 40.86, EMA20 is 40.788. MACD is -0.070, negative. RSI (7-period) is 64.016. The 20-period EMA is 40.675 vs 50-period 41.966, so 20 is below 50. The MACD is negative and trending upwards but still negative. The RSI is in the middle. The volume is below average. Maybe a short opportunity if the trend continues, but not sure yet.\n\nBTCUSDT is up 0.11% in 1 hour but down 0.22% in 4 hours. The MACD is 9.001, positive, and RSI (7-period) is 69.867. The 20-period EMA is below the 50-period. The MACD is positive and increasing. The price is approaching the EMA20. Maybe a long if it breaks above the EMA20. The RSI isn't overbought yet. But the 4-hour trend is slightly negative. Need to see if the short-term momentum is strong enough.\n\nETHUSDT has a positive MACD of 2.143 and RSI of 73.460.

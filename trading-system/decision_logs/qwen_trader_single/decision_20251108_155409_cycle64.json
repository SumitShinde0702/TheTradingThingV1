  "cot_trace": "\u003cthink\u003e\nOkay, let's start by looking at the Sharpe Ratio provided, which is 0.05. That's a very low value, indicating that the current strategy isn't performing well. The goal is to maximize the Sharpe Ratio, so I need to adjust the trading approach.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the current positions. The account has no open positions, so there's room to open new ones if there are strong signals. The Sharpe Ratio is negative, which means I need to be cautious and only take high-confidence trades to avoid further losses.\n\nLooking at the candidate coins, I'll analyze each one's technical indicators. Let's start with DOGEUSDT. The price is slightly above the EMA20, and the MACD is at 0.000, which might indicate a neutral trend. The RSI is 72.393, which is approaching overbought territory. The EMA20 is lower than the 50-period EMA, suggesting a possible downtrend. However, the recent RSI has been rising, so maybe there's a short-term upward movement. But with the MACD not showing a strong signal, I'm not confident enough here.\n\nNext, ADAUSDT. The price is above EMA20, and the MACD is 0.001, which is slightly positive. The RSI is 77.372, which is overbought. The 20-period EMA is lower than the 50-period EMA, indicating a potential downtrend. The MACD histogram is positive but not very strong. The RSI's upward trend might suggest a short-term rally, but given the overbought condition, it could be a good time to consider a short position. However, the confidence level might not be high enough yet.\n\nHYPEUSDT has a negative MACD (-0.085) and the price is above the EMA20. The RSI is 70.651, which is high but not overbought. The 20-period EMA is lower than the 50-period EMA, indicating a possible downtrend. The MACD is improving, but it's still negative. The volume is below average, so there's less conviction in the trend. Maybe not the best candidate right now.\n\nBTCUSDT is in a downtrend with a negative MACD and RSI at 69.617. The price is below the 20-period EMA. The 20-period EMA is lower than the 50-period EMA, which is a bearish signal. However, the RSI is not overbought or oversold, so maybe it's consolidating. No strong signal here for a trade.\n\nETHUSDT has a positive MACD (1.784) and RSI at 75.511, which is overbought. The price is above the EMA20, and the 20-period EMA is lower than the 50-period EMA. The MACD is positive and increasing, which could indicate a bullish trend. However, the RSI being overbought might suggest a potential reversal. This could be a candidate for a short position if the trend reverses, but the confidence is moderate.\n\nSOLUSDT has a negative MACD (-0.095) and RSI at 66.469. The price is slightly above the EMA20. The 20-period EMA is lower than the 50-period EMA, indicating a downtrend. The MACD is negative but improving. The RSI is in a neutral to high range. Not a strong enough signal for a trade.\n\nBNBUSDT has a positive MACD (0.824) and RSI at 64.564. The price is above the EMA20, and the 20-period EMA is lower than the 50-period EMA. The MACD is positive but not very strong. The RSI is in a healthy range. This might be a potential long, but the MACD isn't strong enough for high confidence.\n\nXRPUSDT has a positive MACD (0.004) and RSI at 65.638. The price is slightly above the EMA20. The 20-period EMA is lower than the 50-period EMA. The MACD is positive but very weak. The RSI is in a neutral range. Not a strong signal here.\n\nConsidering all the coins, the Sharpe Ratio is too low to take any trades. The best approach is to wait for stronger signals. None of the coins have a high enough confidence level to justify opening a position. It's better to avoid trading when the Sharpe Ratio is negative to prevent further losses. The next step is to wait and monitor for stronger trends or clearer signals in the next cycles.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\n```json",

  "raw_response": "\u003cthink\u003e\nOkay, let's start by looking at the Sharpe Ratio provided, which is 0.05. That's a very low value, indicating that the current strategy isn't performing well. The goal is to maximize the Sharpe Ratio, so I need to adjust the trading approach.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the current positions. The account has no open positions, so there's room to open new ones if there are strong signals. The Sharpe Ratio is negative, which means I need to be cautious and only take high-confidence trades to avoid further losses.\n\nLooking at the candidate coins, I'll analyze each one's technical indicators. Let's start with DOGEUSDT. The price is slightly above the EMA20, and the MACD is at 0.000, which might indicate a neutral trend. The RSI is 72.393, which is approaching overbought territory. The EMA20 is lower than the 50-period EMA, suggesting a possible downtrend. However, the recent RSI has been rising, so maybe there's a short-term upward movement. But with the MACD not showing a strong signal, I'm not confident enough here.\n\nNext, ADAUSDT. The price is above EMA20, and the MACD is 0.001, which is slightly positive. The RSI is 77.372, which is overbought. The 20-period EMA is lower than the 50-period EMA, indicating a potential downtrend. The MACD histogram is positive but not very strong. The RSI's upward trend might suggest a short-term rally, but given the overbought condition, it could be a good time to consider a short position. However, the confidence level might not be high enough yet.\n\nHYPEUSDT has a negative MACD (-0.085) and the price is above the EMA20. The RSI is 70.651, which is high but not overbought. The 20-period EMA is lower than the 50-period EMA, indicating a possible downtrend. The MACD is improving, but it's still negative. The volume is below average, so there's less conviction in the trend. Maybe not the best candidate right now.\n\nBTCUSDT is in a downtrend with a negative MACD and RSI at 69.617.

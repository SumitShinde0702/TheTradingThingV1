  "cot_trace": "\u003cthink\u003e\nOkay, let's start by looking at the current Sharpe Ratio, which is -0.10. That's below zero, indicating that the strategy is not performing well. The user wants to maximize the Sharpe Ratio, so I need to adjust the strategy accordingly. \n\nFirst, I'll check the current positions. There are two short positions: XRPUSDT and HYPEUSDT. Both are showing negative P\u0026L. The XRPUSDT short has a -1.29% return, and HYPEUSDT is at -1.84%. Since these are both losing positions and have been open for only 3 and 2 minutes respectively, maybe it's better to close them to cut losses. However, the Sharpe Ratio is negative, so perhaps holding them longer might let the market move in our favor. But given the short time held and the negative returns, it might be prudent to close them to prevent further losses.\n\nLooking at the candidate coins for new opportunities. Let's analyze each one:\n\n1. **XRPUSDT**: The current price is 2.32, EMA20 is 2.315. Price is above EMA, which is a bearish signal. MACD is positive (0.003), which is a bullish sign. RSI (7) is 68.318, not overbought yet. But the 4-hour MACD is negative. Maybe not a strong short signal here.\n\n2. **DOGEUSDT**: Price is 0.18, EMA20 is 0.179. Price is slightly above EMA. MACD is 0.000, neutral. RSI (7) is 73.509, approaching overbought. Volume is below average. Not a strong signal.\n\n3. **ADAUSDT**: Price is 0.58, EMA20 is 0.578. Price above EMA. MACD positive (0.001), RSI (7) 78.761 (overbought). Volume is below average. Maybe a short opportunity here if the RSI reverts.\n\n4. **HYPEUSDT**: Already in a short position. The current price is 40.90, EMA20 is 40.781. Price is above EMA. MACD is -0.084 (bearish). RSI (7) is 71.381. Volume is below average. The 4-hour MACD is mixed. Not a strong signal to add more.\n\n5. **BTCUSDT**: Price is 102314.70, EMA20 is 102187.33. Price above EMA. MACD is -2.170 (bearish). RSI (7) 68.978. Not overbought yet. Volume is below average. Maybe a short opportunity if the trend continues.\n\n6. **ETHUSDT**: Price is 3448.00, EMA20 is 3439.718. Price above EMA. MACD is 1.730 (bullish). RSI (7) 74.527 (overbought). Volume is below average. Not a good short signal here.\n\n7. **SOLUSDT**: Price is 160.89, EMA20 is 160.585. Slight positive MACD (-0.096). RSI (7) 66.192. Neutral. Not a strong signal.\n\n8. **BNBUSDT**: Price is 994.73, EMA20 is 993.154. Price above EMA. MACD positive (0.802). RSI (7) 62.396. Neutral. Not a strong signal.\n\nConsidering the Sharpe Ratio is negative, I need to be cautious. The current positions are both losing. Closing them might be better to avoid further losses. For new positions, ADAUSDT is overbought with RSI at 78.761, which might indicate a potential short. BTCUSDT has a bearish MACD but RSI is not overbought. Maybe opening a short on BTCUSDT if the trend continues. However, the Sharpe Ratio is negative, so maybe wait for stronger signals.\n\nGiven the constraints, the best action is to close the losing positions and wait for better opportunities. No strong signals for new positions right now. The Sharpe Ratio is negative, so avoiding overtrading is crucial.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\n```json",
